# Reverse-Engg-Client-Server-Comm
Design and Reverse Engineer Communications between a client and server
This project develops a client, server and encrypts the communication between them.
The communication activities are then reverse engineered using IDA Pro to understand the functions used by Windows for such purposes, and also gain familiarity with x86, x64 constructs.
It is developed using C++
This project was done with a classmate, Peter Carenzo.
